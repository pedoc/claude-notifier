# Changelog

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Clickable macOS notifications via [`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier). When installed, clicks (and the action button) focus the specific VS Code window the notification fired from instead of opening Script Editor. Falls back to the previous `osascript` notification when `terminal-notifier` is not present. ([#12](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/issues/12))
- New command **"Claude Notifier: Install terminal-notifier (clickable macOS notifications)"** — detects Homebrew, opens an interactive terminal, and runs `brew install terminal-notifier` so the user sees the install output. Reload the window after install to pick up the new behavior.
- Per-window routing: Stop hooks include the firing session's `cwd`, and each VS Code window only fires a notification when the `cwd` is inside one of its workspace folders. Two parallel Claude sessions in two different windows now produce two notifications, each in the correct window.

### Fixed

- The notifier now keeps working in terminal Claude / the Claude desktop app after VS Code is closed. Previously, closing the last VS Code window tore down the hook scripts entirely; now teardown only happens on actual extension uninstall (via `vscode:uninstall`). The hook's existing terminal-fallback path delivers sound and system notification when no VS Code window is active.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-15

Contributions in this release by [@agrigoriev](https://github.com/agrigoriev).

### Added

- Configurable debounce interval for task-completion notifications, suppressing rapid-fire alerts during back-to-back completions.
- Improved notification handling and sound playback logic for more reliable cross-platform behavior.

### Fixed

- The question hook now guards against a missing `matcher` field. A misconfigured `PreToolUse` entry without `matcher: "AskUserQuestion"` previously fired the question notification on every tool call; the extension's setup check now rewrites such stale entries. ([#9](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/issues/9), [#10](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/pull/10))
- Replaced the single `claude-notifier-active` flag file with a `claude-notifier-active.d/` directory containing one PID-named marker per live extension instance. This resolves two coordination bugs in the extension↔hook active-flag protocol: a stale flag lingering after an extension-host crash caused stop hooks to defer indefinitely; and with multiple VS Code windows open, the first to deactivate would tear down hooks while other windows remained active. Hooks now verify that at least one marker corresponds to a live process before deferring. ([#8](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/issues/8), [#9](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/issues/9))

## [2.1.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Windows hook scripts now correctly read VS Code settings. `$env:USERPROFILE` was not resolving when Claude Code spawned PowerShell with `-NoProfile -NonInteractive`, causing sound and notification level settings to be silently ignored and always falling back to defaults. Replaced with `$PSScriptRoot`, which reliably points to the hooks directory in all execution contexts. ([#4](https://github.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/issues/4))

### Added

- Remote session support: when Claude Code runs on a remote host (SSH, Dev Containers, WSL), the extension now plays a terminal bell via VS Code's BEL sequence, which is forwarded to the local client. Webview audio is blocked by Electron's autoplay policy in remote contexts, making this the reliable fallback.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- Marketplace republish to resolve extension visibility issue.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Per-event notification levels: `sound+popup`, `sound`, `popup`, or `off` — configurable independently for task completion, permission requests, and questions.
- Per-event sound presets for both macOS (Basso, Blow, Bottle, Frog, Funk, Glass, Hero, Morse, Ping, Pop, Purr, Sosumi, Submarine, Tink) and Windows (Windows Notify, tada, chimes, chord, ding, notify, ringin, Windows Background).
- Settings sync: VS Code settings are written to `~/.claude/hooks/claude-notifier-config.json` and picked up by hook scripts at runtime.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Three distinct hooks: `Stop` (task completed), `PermissionRequest` (needs tool approval), `PreToolUse` for `AskUserQuestion` (question asked).
- macOS and Windows support via platform-specific hook scripts (Node.js / PowerShell).
- WSL detection: WSL sessions call `powershell.exe` for sounds and notifications.
- Mute toggle via status bar icon or command palette (`Claude Notifier: Toggle Sound`).
- Auto-configures `~/.claude/settings.json` on activation, cleans up on uninstall.
- Homebrew tap support for macOS/Linux CLI install.
