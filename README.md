Plays a sound and shows a notification when [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) finishes a task, needs permission, or asks a question.

Stop watching the screen — go grab a coffee and let Claude ping you when it needs you.

Works with **VSCode**, **terminal CLI**, **vim**, or any editor where you use Claude Code — on **macOS**, **Windows**, **WSL**, and **Linux**, including **remote hosts over SSH**.

## What's new — 3.5.0

- **Remote audio.** When Claude runs on a remote host (SSH, WSL, dev container), notification sounds now play on your **local** machine instead of the headless remote — see [Remote hosts](#remote-hosts-ssh-wsl-dev-containers).
- **Per-session disable.** Set `CLAUDE_NOTIFIER_DISABLE` to silence the notifier for a single shell/session — handy on shared SSH hosts (see [below](#disable-per-session-claude_notifier_disable)).
- **Status-bar control panel.** Hover the **Claude** entry in the status bar for volume, per-event sound preview/swap, and the minimum-task-duration threshold.

## Install

### Option 1: VSCode Extension

Install from the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SingularityInc.claude-notifier):

```sh
code --install-extension SingularityInc.claude-notifier
```

Or search for **"Claude Notifier"** in the Extensions tab (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`).

The extension auto-configures everything on activation. Reload VSCode after installing.


### Option 2: CLI (curl)

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/main/install.sh | bash
```

To uninstall:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashmitb95/claude-notifier/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

**Windows:** install the VSCode extension. It auto-configures the PowerShell hooks; no separate CLI installer is needed.

## Remote hosts (SSH, WSL, dev containers)

When Claude runs on a **remote host**, notification sounds can play on your **local** machine instead of the (usually headless) remote — with your normal sound presets and volume, no terminal bell. A small `cn-daemon` helper runs locally, and the remote pushes events to it over an SSH reverse forward.

This is **opt-in**; existing local setups are unaffected. See **[docs/REMOTE_HOSTS.md](docs/REMOTE_HOSTS.md)** for the one-time setup (install the daemon, add a `RemoteForward` line, enable `claudeNotifier.remoteAudio`), or run **`Claude Notifier: Set up remote audio…`** from the Command Palette to walk through it.

## Configurable Settings

Open **Settings** → search **"Claude Notifier"** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) to set each event's notification level (`sound+popup` | `sound` | `popup` | `off`) and sound preset.

**Sound presets** — macOS: Basso, Blow, Bottle, Frog, Funk, Glass, Hero, Morse, Ping, Pop, Purr, Sosumi, Submarine, Tink. Windows: Windows Notify, tada, chimes, chord, ding, notify, ringin, Windows Background. On Linux the macOS names map to freedesktop XDG sounds under `/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/`.

### Minimum task duration threshold

`claudeNotifier.minTaskDurationThreshold` (seconds, default `0`)

When `> 0`, notification sounds and popups are suppressed for any task that completes in less than this many seconds. Counted from the moment you submit the prompt. Set to `0` to disable (the default).

Useful when you're actively watching the IDE and don't need audio for sub-second roundtrips — set it to e.g. `10` and you'll only hear audio for longer-running work. Per-session marker files keep parallel Claude sessions (multiple terminals or VS Code windows) independent — each session times its own threshold.

### Auto-mute when focused

`claudeNotifier.autoMuteWhenFocused` *(boolean, default `false`)*

When on, the task-completed sound and all popups are suppressed while the VS Code window running the task is focused — if you're already looking at it, the notification is redundant. It's scoped per-window: a task finishing in a **background** window still notifies, so multi-window setups aren't silenced. Permission and question sounds still play. Toggle it quickly from the status-bar panel (hover the **Claude** item) or the **Claude Notifier: Toggle Auto-mute When Focused** command.

### Subagent handling

Claude Code emits an `agent_id` field on every hook payload that fires from inside a `Task` subagent. Two settings use this:

`claudeNotifier.suppressSubagentInteractions` *(boolean, default `true`)*

When true, permission and question hooks that originate from a subagent are silenced — no sound, no OS banner. The main agent's own permission and question prompts still notify normally. This affects **only the notifier's sound and popup**; the actual approve/deny dialog and question UI in Claude Code's chat are untouched.

`claudeNotifier.subagentCompleted.level` *(default `off`)*

A dedicated `SubagentStop` hook fires when a `Task` subagent finishes. The level defaults to `off`, so subagent completions are silent unless you opt in. Configurable like the other events:

- `claudeNotifier.subagentCompleted.level`: `sound+popup` | `sound` | `popup` | `off`
- `claudeNotifier.subagentCompleted.sound`: a sound preset (default `Pop`)

## How it works

- **Per-session dedup.** Rapid back-to-back events within a single Claude session coalesce automatically — one notification per stage, not a flood. A stage advances when you send your next prompt or after ~30 minutes of idle time.
- **Bundled fallback sounds.** If the configured system sound file is missing on disk, a bundled WAV plays so you still hear something.
- **Defers to other notification hosts.** Inside VS Code, the extension takes over from the hook fallback for the owning window. Inside [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), the hook detects cmux's `CMUX_CLAUDE_HOOK_CMUX_BIN` env var and skips its own sound + popup so cmux's native banner doesn't get double-stacked.
- **Diagnostic log.** `View → Output → Claude Notifier` shows activation, signal receipts, dedup decisions, and configuration warnings — useful when debugging "I didn't get a notification."

### Clickable macOS notifications (optional)

By default, macOS attributes `osascript` notifications to the Script Editor bundle, so clicking one opens Script Editor instead of focusing VS Code. To get clickable notifications that focus the specific window the notification fired from, install [`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier):

```sh
brew install terminal-notifier
```

Or use the bundled command — open the Command Palette and run **"Claude Notifier: Install terminal-notifier (clickable macOS notifications)"**. It runs the `brew install` in an interactive VS Code terminal so you can see what's happening. Reload the window after install to enable it.

When `terminal-notifier` is present, the extension uses it automatically. When it's not, the extension falls back to the standard `osascript` notification (everything still works — clicks just open Script Editor).

## Mute/unmute (CLI)

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```sh
touch ~/.claude/hooks/claude-notifier-muted   # mute
rm ~/.claude/hooks/claude-notifier-muted      # unmute
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
New-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\hooks\claude-notifier-muted"   # mute
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\hooks\claude-notifier-muted" # unmute
```

## Disable per session (`CLAUDE_NOTIFIER_DISABLE`)

The mute flag above is machine-wide. To silence the hooks for a **single session only** — e.g. when SSHing into a shared host so your sessions don't play sounds on someone else's machine — set `CLAUDE_NOTIFIER_DISABLE` in that shell. When set (to any value other than empty/`0`/`false`), every hook exits without sound, popup, or signal; sessions in other shells are unaffected.

```sh
export CLAUDE_NOTIFIER_DISABLE=1   # add to your shell rc to make it permanent
```
